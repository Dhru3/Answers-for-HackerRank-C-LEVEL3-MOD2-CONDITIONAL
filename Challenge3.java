//Write a program to print the vales from 1 to n. Use goto statement to perform looping operation

//In languages like C and C++, goto allows a program to jump directly to a labeled part of the code. 
//While this can make code shorter, it often results in "spaghetti code" â€” code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain. 
//The flow of control is unpredictable and can jump to various parts of the program.

//Thus I jave used an alternate method to solve this problem not using the "goto" statement.
